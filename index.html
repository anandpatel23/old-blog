									<h3>MIPS-32 CPU Processor</h3>
									<img src="images/processor.png" alt="Project Picture" width="400" height="300">
									<p>We developed a complete VHDL description of the MIPS-32 CPU and simulated it by executing a set of programs to demonstrate correct functionality of the processor. The simulation, debugging, and testing of the VHDL code were conducted in ModelSim.</p>

									<h3>"Let's Go Fishing" - Pokemon Fishing Game</h3>
									<img src="images/letsGoFishing.png" alt="Project Picture" width="400" height="300">
									<p>We created a Pokemon based fishing game using a MATLAB GUI as the platform. This was interfaced with an accelerometer that used the arduino as a microcontroller. We were able to successfully implement features such as a Pokemon like loading screen, reeling and casting a fishing rod using the accelerometer and simulating the action and results within MATLAB.</p>

									<h3>CIGNA "Train YOU" Application</h3>
									<p>Role: Creator, Project Manager, and User Experience Designer </p> 

										<p></p>Within my first co-op at CIGNA, I led the TECDP co-ops to create a <strong>proof of concept</strong> application called Train YOU as our final project. This consisted of an iOS/Android based application that would encourage Cigna insured users to become healthier and help with the "GO YOU" initiative. 

										Features:
										-QR Code Scanner of labels on a Gym Equipment Machine with viewable instructions on how to use sed machine with animations and text
										-Worked with Healthy Life Coaches to create Training Plan portion of application with workout plan instructions and the ability to request a plan
										-Integration of Healthy Life Coaches: Call a coach, Message a Coach, Incentives, Request a Plan
										-Biometrics Measurements: Body Mass Index, Fat Loss, Muscle Gain</p>

									<h3>Bio-sensing Device for Medical Applications</h3>
									<img src="images/bandDraft.png" alt="Draft of Band" width="320" height="320">
									<p>In short, we were able to visualize bio-feedback and response systems to simulate signals visualized in medical applications. This implemented through an Arduino controlled wristband to monitor hypoglycemia through heart rate and perspiration. Check out our blog <a href="http://du2013-grp065-01.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Autonomous Waste Robot</h3>
									<img src="images/robot.jpg" alt="robot pictures" width="320" height="212">
									<p>A quarter into the  winter semester during freshman year, I was responsible for building and programming an autonomous waste disposal robot using Lego NXT since my teammates had to leave the class for unknown reasons. This was a very exciting challenge for me since I was able to have experience with Lego NXT in High School. I was introduced to sensor operation, algorithm design and robotics through hands-on-design and course-wide challenge in a decision-making environment. As an objective, I was able to design and build a robot able to autonomously separate trash and nuclear waste, delivering the trash to an incinerator and the nuclear waste to a depot for safe disposal.  </p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="me" width="320" height="480" /></a>
							
							<p>When my girlfriend isn't forcing me to pose for a modeling session, I'm usually involved as a Brother within Lambda Chi Alpha at Drexel University. Also, I'm an avid enthusiast of discovering music. I'm currently using <a href="https://8tracks.com">8tracks</a> as my primary source for music. I listen to music when I'm studying, browsing the internet, programming, and working out. Speaking of, I'm an amateur bodybuilding enthusiast so that helps dictate a healthy lifestyle for me. My next project is to build an application that will help people gear towards a healthier lifestyle.</p>

							<p>Also, learning new technologies and programming takes up a decent portion of my time. I love learning about new things and whether it'd be reading about something new or getting my hands dirty and coding it, I'm all up for it. Also, I'm a novice photographer (but in college, who isn't? haha)</p>
